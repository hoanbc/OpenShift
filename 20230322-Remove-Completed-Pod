#When a Job completes, no more Pods are created, but the Pods are not deleted either. Keeping them around allows you to still view the logs of completed pods to check for errors, warnings, or other diagnostic output. The job object also remains after it is completed so that you can view its status. It is up to the user to delete old jobs after noting their status. Delete the job with kubectl (e.g. kubectl delete jobs/pi or kubectl delete -f ./job.yaml). When you delete the job using kubectl, all the pods it created are deleted too.

You can list all completed pods by:
kubectl get pod --field-selector=status.phase==Succeeded

delete all completed pods by:
kubectl delete pod --field-selector=status.phase==Succeeded

and delete all errored pods by:
kubectl delete pod --field-selector=status.phase==Failed
